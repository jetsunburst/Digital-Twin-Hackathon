Aseptic Operator successfully performed the filling process, filling 100 vials with a sterile growth medium.
Environmental monitoring within the clean room maintained air quality and particulate levels within established limits.
No visual signs of microbial contamination were observed in any of the filled vials during the incubation period.
Temperature and humidity conditions during the experiment remained consistent with required parameters.
The media fill experiment successfully validated the aseptic filling process, demonstrating its ability to maintain sterility.
